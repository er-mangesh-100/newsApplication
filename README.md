## Project Overview

The News App is a responsive web application that provides users with the latest news across various categories, including IPL, Finance, Politics, Technology, and Crime. The app fetches real-time news data using the NewsAPI and displays it in a clean and intuitive interface. Users can easily navigate through different news categories or search for specific topics.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Content Loading:** The app fetches news articles based on user selection or search query.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.
- **Interactive Navigation:** Users can switch between different news categories and perform searches directly from the navigation bar.
- **News Cards:** Each news article is displayed as a card, containing the title, source, publication date, and a brief description. Clicking on a card opens the full article in a new tab.

### Technologies Used
